The evolution of stratal sequences along the mid-Norwegian margin (i.e. along the A-A’ cross-section), in particular between 70 and 56 Ma. b) Dynamic topography at continental and passive margins, c) sea-level variations and d) tectonic uplift and subsidence responsible for the depositional system on the Norway mid-margin. e) The wheeler diagram along the cross-section A-A’ of the model incorporating modified Miller et al. (2005) sea-level, the Hybrid dynamic topography and two phases of onshore uplift (model H2q). The orange dotted line indicates the shoreline trajectory. The stratal sequence is recorded in 1 Myr time intervals. The Wheeler diagram is coloured by paleo-depth that can be used to represent different depositional environments. Given that grain size is determined by depositional environments, facies successions can be derived. Corresponding stratal sequence and key surfaces (SB: sequence boundaries; MRS: maximum regressive surfaces; MFS: maximum flooding surfaces) are also represented. Line graphs showing dynamic topography tested in this study (left) and the modified Miller et al. (2005) short term sea-level curve (middle).
