## climate_map
These climate maps are obtained from Valdes and Scotese (in prep) and modified according to Moosdorf (2018) global erodibility index to account for lateral variation of erodibility.

## elastic_thickness_map
These elastic thickness (Te) maps have been obtained from Pérez-Gussinyé & Watts (2005) free-air admittance Greenland Te map (Steffen et al., 2018) Bouguer anomaly grids and global elastic thickness maps (Tesauro et al., 2012; Watts, 2012).
