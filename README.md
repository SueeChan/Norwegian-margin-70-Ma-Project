# Norwegian margin 70 Ma

## Description
This model explores the relative contribution of different factors, in particular, the Iceland Plume and onshore tectonic uplift, on sediment dynamics along the Norwegian margin between the Late Cretaceous and Miocene. This simulation includes a Hybrid dynamic topography, combining Barnett-Moore et al. (2017) dynamic topography grid and Skogseid et al. (2014) findings, and Paleogene and Neogene onshore uplift. Horizontal displacements from rift opening and seafloor spreading are also taken into account. The simulation shows that a higher wavelength and amplitude of the Iceland Plume than what is modelled by Barnett-Moore et al. (2017) better reproduces sediment dispersal pattern and sediment thickness along the mid-Norwegian margin. It also demonstrates that 1) the role of dynamic topography is most important during the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, 2) the influence of onshore tectonic uplift on sedimentation become obvious after 50 Ma and its presence is suggested, 3) flexural adjustment and sea-level fluctuation become an important driver of sedimentation in the region during Eocene and from Oligocene to Miocene respectively.
